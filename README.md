## Buddhist Context

In Buddhist tradition, 108 is considered a sacred number representing:
- 108 defilements to overcome
- 108 beads on a traditional mala
- Various spiritual significances in Buddhist cosmology

This digital counter honors that tradition while providing the convenience of modern technology for meditation practice.
